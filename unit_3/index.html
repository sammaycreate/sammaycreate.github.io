     <h1> Sam May Create</h1>
     <p id="slogan"><b><i>a girl seeks beauty allowing her maker to show it defined</b></i></p>
     <p>For the better part of my adult life, I have wanted to travel the world and I have. (Someday, I'll ask you to sit and stay awhile while I share some adventures. I also want to sit and stay a while and hear yours too.)  I've got a bit of a gypsy soul to say the least. But at the end of the day, I need somewhere to gather my thoughts.</p>
     
     <p>this space will include things I've learned and gathered along the way:</p>

	     <ul>
	     <li>words, lovely words</li>
	     <li>photographs of everything</li>
	     <li>beauty in all shapes and sizes</li>
	     <li>exploring here and there</li>
	     </ul>
